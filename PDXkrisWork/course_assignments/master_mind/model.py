"Easy to learn. Easy to play. But not so easy to win."

How to Play:
1. The computer generates a Secret Code of four code pegs.
2. The player chooses four code pegs and the position they go in, in an attempt 
to match position and color of the Secret Code.
3. The computer evalues the player choice and gives the following feedback via 
pegs:
	Black Peg: One for each code peg that is the right color and in the right 
	position.
	White Peg: One for each code peg that is the right color, but in the wrong
	position.
4. The player gets 10 rounds to accurately figure out the Secret Code. If they 
do it within 10 rounds, they win, otherwise they lose.
