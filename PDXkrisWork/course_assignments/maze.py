# Date Started: 2015.01.08
# Date Finished: 
# Created By: Kris Kuchinka
# Assignment at PDX Code Guild
#----------------------------------->

# The object of the Maze Game:
# Create a text-based maze with at least five rooms
# The five rooms can include the start and finish rooms
# The game must handle incorrect decisions politely
# Extra: handle inputs w/out case sensitivity
# Extra Extra: Add a trap
# Extra Extra Extra: Output path taken to the finish (allow
	# user to start over or exit)
#---------------------------------->

# Those are the rules, now let's play a game...

# Basic premise, to be edited later. User wakes up in mysterious lodge
# and doesn't know how they got there or where they are. They can tell
# that there are other structures, but it's foggy, so you can't make
# anything out of it. User must find their way to the parking lot, where 
# a sleek Audi awaits them, waiting to take them to safety.

# Each building at the Dark Moor Pond needs to be it's own function
# Each function has if elifs for movement options
# Each function has a string explanation of the room they are in
# Each function choice should refer and instantiate a different function
