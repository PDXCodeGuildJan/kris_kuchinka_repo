							Introduction
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Purpose: To create a replication of the game known as Angry Dice.

This is a project that I was assigned to complete during the course of my 
studies at PDX Code Guild. This was assigned to our class by Tiffany Caires. 
The flow chart of game and UML diagram that was used to code this program was 
created with with Sarah Fellows at PDX Code Guild, along with myself.

Anybody can play this game, if they know the rules. The rules can be accessed 
inside the game module. When the game begins, the user is prompted about wether 
they need to see the rules or not. Players are also advised that they can quit 
at any time by entering the letter 'q' or 'Q' in any input option.

The game module takes in the player's name and is created with the idea that it 
simulates the Angry Dice game in a realistic manner. Ideally, it would be used 
to play against another player. The game objective is to complete the 3 stages 
faster than the other player playing.

						Dependencies and Deployment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In order to access the game module, the user will need to have a way to open it
in a Python 3 shell. For example, on my MacBook Pro, I can access it through the 
terminal. To do so, I navigate to the folder path where the module is being 
stored. Then, once in the proper folder, simply type in "Python3 angry_dice.py" 
and hit enter. 

Besides having a way to run and process a Python 3 module, there are no specific 
configurations that are needed to play the game. Once the game has been started, 
the input options provide the user with all the required resources to quickly
navigate through each stage and compete against another player.

						 		Conclusion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Angry Dice is a fun two player game (maybe more, if you really want to amp up
the competition). Having the ability to play it on a computer, sans dice, makes 
it possible to play through the stages quicker, once you get the hang of the 
flow of the game. 

All of that being said, enjoy the game!
